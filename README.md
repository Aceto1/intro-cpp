# Intro to C++

This repository contains solutions to the worksheets of the "Object Oriented Programming With C++" course at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena.

## Structure
The worksheets are ordered according to their "release date", meaning folder "1" contains the solutions to the first worksheet and so on.

## Building
All of these were built using g++ on Windows.

`g++ -g 1.cpp -o 1.exe`

There are tasks for VS Code which build the executables correctly and/or attach a debugger.
